# Causal Analysis on Osteoporosis Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project applies **causal analysis techniques** on an **osteoporosis dataset** to explore potential cause–effect relationships between medical, demographic, and lifestyle variables. The goal is to go beyond simple correlations and investigate whether certain factors *causally influence* bone health outcomes.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- **`Osteoporosis.csv`**: The dataset used in the analysis.  
- **`Causal Analysis of Osteoporosis Dataset.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with the complete analysis pipeline.  
- **`Causal Analysis of Osteoporosis Dataset.pdf`**: Exported static version of the notebook for easier viewing.  

## ⚙️ Requirements
To run the notebook, you will need Python 3.8+ and the following libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy statsmodels causalinference dowhy
